Hi to all

I try to explain, sorry for the long writting ,

Whereas we are looking to exploit the actual firmware of the Mark2 for the DualZGE-Mark2

Finally, the ZGE-Mark2 is identical to 90%, the 10% difference essentially concerns the tool change process, which has to be done in a different way.

- T1 is dockable at the front right corner for both systems

- Mark 2 : T0 is integral with the gantry which is able to directly add the T1 to it in addition

- ZGE-Mark2: T0 is detachable from gantry to be replaced by T1, it is therefore necessary and obligatory to dock first T0 before picking the T1, whatever the conditions of the activity moment of the printer.

- The T0 docking bracket is located, mirroring the T1 one on the right, at the front left corner.

- T0 and T1 print head are mirrored identical

It would therefore be necessary to be able to add to the firmware the identification of this additional T0 dock and the different routing commands for the T0 dock /undock

The picking means is a bit different from that of the Mark2, in addition to the location coordinates of the dock, it is necessary to respect 2 other points of XY coordinates, this for have enough clearance distance to avoid to collide the Gantry/Cooling fans , in one side(X direction) on the dock arm bracket and in the other side(Y direction)to collide the cooling fan on the T0/T1 print head bottom.

The exact Dual ZGE-Mark2 needed XY points docking position and 90° clearance distance points

- Right Docking position : X 215.5 Y0

- X direction right docking clearance point from docking position : X 165.5 Y0

- Y direction right docking clearance point from docking position : X 215.5 Y40

- Left Docking position : X11 Y0

- X direction left docking clearance point from docking position : X 50 Y0

- Y direction left docking clearance point from docking position : X 11 Y40

Would the routine be applied automatically at each required tool change ?

For sample :

Considering the T0 is at Home position

If as the actual firmware Start print of the Mark2, the start move first to T1 to prime it

That would say that is obligatory to the ZGE-Mark2 to move first to dock T0 before to go pick T1

It will need to insert in the Start/End commands the T1 to T0 tool change and vice versa

Gcode sequence I used a.t.m. for the tool change

……

G21

G90

G28

G1 X50 Y0 Fnnn ; move to front left clearance point

G1 X 11 Y0 Fnnn ; move to dock T0 position

G1 X 11 Y40 Fnnn ; move the T0 Y docking clearance distance point

G1 X215.5 Y40 Fnnn ; move to T1 Y docking clearence distance point

G1 X215.5 Y0 Fnnn ; move to pick T1 on the right docking position

G1 X165.5 Y0 Fnnn ; move to T1 X docking clearance distance point (undockT1)

……

And vice versa to return to T1…. then finally return to Home

G28

………

The existant “ ; move away from the prime poop “ commands could not be used

The prime position just before going print could be the same for the T0 / T1 on front center location

Or separate for each print head

T0 at minima on” X50 Y0 “point position or a bit away

T1 at minima on” X165.5 Y0” point position or a bit away

For any decided T0/T1 prime position ,having the possibility to play with the “retractation” function before go to print

About the Dual mode firmware Settings ;

All could be OK at the exception to indeed apply the T0 docking routing in “ Change extruder ”menu

And add/modify in the “ Docking position “ menu, the tunning position for T0 and forT1

About the End print

In any condition of End print, the Home G28 must be done with the T0 in place on the Gantry

The T0 could not stay docked because of it will block the Home End stop possibility, Y rod will be blocked when X0.

If End print with T0 move direct to Home just after the end print commands

If End print with T1 after docking it, go to pick T0 before Home.

All the other things, on the firmware would suit to the ZGE-Mark2 management, I think without be sure at 100%
